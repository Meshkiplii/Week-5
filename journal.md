Content Insights
Collaboration with the Rashfield theme served to strengthen the perception of how theme scaffolds exist in WordPress. I discovered that both themes have unique customizations and styling possibilities and constraints that one needs to consider critically to achieve the style of the site. Also, I realized the significance of changing styles without compromising the actual theme files to build an ability for updates.
Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This learning brought out the utility of efficient time management, in the context of customization of themes. Having limited working time to 5 hours I arranged for the most important features to be brought out. In freelance work designs particularly, this skill is of great importance since it defines quality time usage which correlates with client satisfaction and project profitability. In future I decided to look into child themes so that my choices become even more efficient when it comes to theme modification.
